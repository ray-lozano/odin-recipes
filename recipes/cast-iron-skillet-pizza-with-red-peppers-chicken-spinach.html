        </p>

        <!-- Ingredients list -->
        <h3>Indregients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup jarred roasted red peppers, rinsed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound whole-wheat pizza dough</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped cooked chicken</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped spinach</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>2 ounces goat cheese, crumbled</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Position rack in lower third of oven and place a large cast-iron skillet on it; preheat to 450Â°F. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine red peppers, oil, garlic, salt and pepper in a blender. Puree until smooth. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll and/or stretch pizza dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle. 
                Carefully place the pan on a heatproof surface (remember, the handle will be hot), 
                and transfer the dough to it. Spread the sauce over the dough and top with chicken, spinach, mozzarella and goat cheese. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake the pizza on the lower rack until the crust is browned and the cheese is melted, 15 to 20 minutes. Garnish with basil, if desired. 
            </li>
        </ol>
